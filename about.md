## âœ¨ About Me

Hi! Iâ€™m **Surabhi Raghavan**, a Machine Learning Engineer and Generative AI researcher based in Pittsburgh, PA. Iâ€™m passionate about building intelligent, human-centered systems that scale â€” with a focus on healthcare, anomaly detection, and real-world applications of AI.

Iâ€™m currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Information Science at the University of Pittsburgh (GPA: 3.9/4.0), with coursework and research experience spanning interactive data science at Carnegie Mellon University. I also hold a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from BMS Institute of Technology & Management, India.

My professional journey spans cloud-native software development, mobile health monitoring, and applied machine learning. Most recently, I contributed to backend and performance optimizations at the **Mobile Sensing + Health Institute**, where I integrated AWS cloud services and re-engineered a complex React application. Prior to this, I worked as a **Flutter Developer** and **UI/UX engineer**, delivering production-ready apps and streamlining design systems.

Iâ€™ve co-authored a peer-reviewed paper on **Audio Anomaly Detection using Generative AI**, accepted to the **SynthData Workshop at ICLR 2025**. This research explores LLM-driven synthetic audio generation pipelines for safety-critical applications like content moderation.

Outside of work, I serve as **General Secretary for ANKUR: IGSA**, leading cultural and networking initiatives for the international student community.
