summary:
  - "Developed a novel audio generation framework (AADG) using LLMs and text-to-audio models to simulate realistic scenarios specifically for Audio Anomaly Detection and Localization."
  - "Expanded anomaly detection datasets beyond industrial sounds, addressing diverse real-world environments like telephonic or video-derived audio."
  - "Created a modular, rigorously verified framework enabling scalable and reliable generation of realistic audio data, improving robustness of anomaly detection models against out-of-distribution scenarios."
